Project Description - MyLyfe 
This project aims to create a social media application for users 
to document all parts of their life - hence the name MyLyfe.
We plan to offer pre-built interfaces to log goals and notifications 
to check in and be informed about your friends’ progress updates.
There will also be an Explore page, that will allow users to peek 
into other people’s Lyfes and see what they’re up to: a new workout 
goal? Their fall schedule? A new reading goal? A new smoothie recipe?
The possibilities are endless! There will be scope for inter-user 
communication through likes, shares and comments, and we hope to end 
up with an application that brings all of us closer together and 
creates a supportive community!


What kind of users are we looking for?
A typical user of our website would be someone who is looking to
improve their life and looking for a community to do so. A user 
wanting to begin going to the gym can start here! On our website, 
they will be able to find other users' workout routines, and create 
their own. They will be able to set their own daily, weekly, monthly, 
or yearly goals and check them off. When you’re surrounded by people
working towards the same goal as you, you’re held more accountable 
for your goals and can encourage each other! We hope by creating this 
website other’s will be more inspired to improve their lives in 
whatever way they want!
